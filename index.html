          “About ten months ago, a rumour came to our ears that a spyglass had been made by a certain Dutchman by means of which visible objects, although far removed from the eye of the observer, were distinctly perceived as though nearby.” wrote Galileo Galilei in his 1609 book Siderious Nuncius. The "Dutchman" mentioned here is Hans Lipperhey (1570-1619), a German-born Dutch spectacle-maker and the “spyglass” is now called the telescope, an optical device "for seeing things far away as if they were nearby” that changed science throughout the 17th century and reshaped the later history of science.

        <p>
          Lipperhey’s telescope is a refracting telescope (abbr. refractor). It is composed of two lenses. One of the lenses is called the objective lens. It is a converging lens whose function is to magnify objects. The other one is the eyepiece. It plays the role of a “myopia glass” by readjusting the direction of convergent light so that the image of the objects can be rendered precisely on our retina.

          However, Lipperhey did not seem to intend to observe celestial bodies with his telescope. But, what Galilei Galilei (1564-1642), the Italian astronomer and physicist, had was an ambition far beyond practical purposes such as navigational observation or military reconnaissance. He wanted to see something no man had seen before in the night sky, which motivated him to improve Lipperhey’s design.

          By adjusting the curvature of the lenses and the distance between them, his telescope had a magnification of thirty times “so that the diameter of the same Moon appears as if it were thirty times.”

        <p>
          The first celestial body Galileo observed with his telescope was the Moon. During the two-hour observation, he found that “the shape of the boundary dividing the bright from the dark part (on the Moon) does not form a uniformly oval line.” Thus, he suggested that the moon had a topography just like the Earth, rather than, as many ancient philosophers believed so, a flat surface.
        </p>

          On the night of 7 January 1610, Galileo pointed his telescope at Jupiter. That night, he discovered three new stars around Jupiter.

        </figure>

        <p>According to his observation, these three stars’ positions were changing daily. On the night of 13 January, a fourth star appeared. What Galileo found is the moons of Jupiter. They are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, and we call them Galilean moons.</p>

        <p>Galileo’s observation provided strong evidence for Copernicus' heliocentric theory by the fact that not all celestial bodies orbit the earth. In the next several decades, the technology of telescopes spread rapidly among scientists and the Heliocentric theory that the church upholds faced its biggest challenge.</p>
